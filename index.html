        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Woojae, originally from San Diego, CA, is a <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley alumnus</a> taking his first steps towards joining the professional tech work force in the San Francisco Greater Bay Area. He graduated from Cal with a Bachelor of Arts in <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognitive Science</a> and was an active member of <a href="https://www.calthetachi.com/" target="_blank">Theta Chi Fraternity, Mu Chapter</a>.</p>

      <div class="tab-content" id="ideals">
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is "doing the right thing even when no one is watching."</p>
        <p>At Dev Bootcamp, we are asking you to do a crazy thing: to learn how to be a web developer within a matter of weeks. For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have made Dev Bootcamp successful.</p>
        <p>At Dev Bootcamp, we have codes of conduct that support an optimal learning environment and ensure that everyone gets the most out of the program. We expect you to be in integrity with:
          <ul>
            <li>Showing up on time</li>
            <li>Working through the challenges each week</li>
            <li>Communicating with your accountability group when you are struggling</li>
            <li>Pairing with others</li>
            <li>Asking for help and asking questions</li>
            <li>Submitting and rating feedback</li>
            <li>Going through the entire process outlined in each challenge</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Part of being in integrity also means that when you fall out of it for whatever reason (such as being a human being) you own up to it. Most of the time all it takes is and acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.</p>

        <h2>Kindness</h2>
        <p>We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice"; they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does not preclude giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is <strong>A</strong>ctionable, <strong>S</strong>pecific, and <strong>K</strong>ind (ASK).</p>
        <p>We expect all students and staff to show kindness by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when someone has fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourselves 100% into every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself. You've taken a big risk and are making a big change. Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program.</p>

        <h2>Whole Self</h2>
        <p>We expect you to bring your intelligence, your focus, your creativity, and your personality into each challenge every day. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including staff) for help. If you find that you're holding some part of you back from this experience, we ask that you focus on being authentic with your pair, your cohort, and staff. DBC flourishes when all of us feel safe being authentic with each other.</p>
        <p>This includes exposing your ignorance and being open to uncomfortable emotional and technical challenges at DBC.</p>
        <p>We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about <em>learning</em>. We expect you to demonstrate effort and mastery of each learning competency by completing the challenges.</p>

            Check out The Trees Network, a 24/7 video and chat stream with Ents from all over. Themed after cannabis, some entertainment material may be NSFW so watch at your discretion.<br>
            But hey, make an account to watch and talk with Ents. There are movies, tv shows, and short clips on all day.

          <p>
            Take a peek at the sales at HumbleBundle! They offer great deals on games and e-books, and best of all you can opt to partition your payment to go towards charity, to the authors/makers of the products or as a tip to HumbleBundle for their awesome services.<br>
            They have games that are redeemable on Steam, mobile games, and themed e-book sales. Take a look at what they have to offer every now and then as they change frequently (all sales are for timed durations - about a week or so).
